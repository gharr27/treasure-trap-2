Agenda:
	Milestone Chart
		Set Dates and expectations
		
	Beginning Development
		Start working in your teams on your sections for UI and Game Core
		
	GitHub Ediquette
		Post changes to a branch not to the main branch, I'll deal with merging to main
			be very mindful of this, make sure you know what branch you are on when pushing
			don't merge to a branch you didn't make unless otherwise stated	
		Make a new branch for different changes you make.
			Ex. changes to the Main Menu GUI should be on a separate branch to changes to the actual game GUI etc.
		When coding push changes often
			Don't do 3 different things in one push.
			Do three separate push for each item instead.
		Log issues when you find them.
			Check the Git Repo constantly to look for issues you can solve etc.
		
	Code Quality:
		Our code needs to look nice and uniform
		Make good descriptive variable, function, etc names
			The code should explain itself
		Leave comments on everything, even if you think it is self explainatory
		
	Code schema:
		Use camel casing for variables
			ex. someVariable
		Const variables should be all caps
			ex. const int NUMBER
		Brackets should be in this format
			ex. if() {
				}
		Captialize function names
			ex. void Function()
		Capitalize Class/struct names
			ex. Class MyClass; struct MyStruct
		Name bools with is schema
			ex. bool isActive
