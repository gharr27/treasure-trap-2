# Software Development: the CS Capstone Experience

The Computer Science capstone experience is intended to be an applied research class. Many undergraduate academic
majors have an in-depth, research project during their senior year. Computer science is no exception. However, a unique feature of
this research class is the opportunity to apply your research. The class will require you to: 1) utilize your existing level of knowledge
and skill, 2) obtain new knowledge and skill through research and practice, and ultimately 3) combine the two to construct and deploy
for rigorous testing a complex, software application. Your previous courses have given you the foundation needed to add to your
current level of knowledge and skill, which will allow you (along with your teammates) to build a computer program, far and above
what most of you have ever written. We, the faculty, believe that this course serves as a great bridge between Harding and the career
that awaits you.

# What is the Project?
The game this year is an abstract strategy game called Hive. An abstract strategy game (ASG) minimizes luck by ensuring there is no hidden information when making a move, and zero non-deterministic elements (e.g. rolling of dice). Developing an elaborate software version of Hive offers a student the potential for new and continual skill development in areas such as: software design, [OO, network, AI, GUI, and Web] programming, audio/graphic/animation incorporation, maintaining a code repository with version control, unit testing, integration testing, and automating an installation. Hive is an easy game to learn but takes time to master.

# The software you will develop has the following basic requirements:
- The game will be written for the Microsoft Windows 10 / 64 bit operating system. The testing machines will be those located in the Software Project Lab (Sci 203). Each team will be assigned one of the workstations.
- Ease of use and robust error handling.
- An AI developed to allow a novice or expert to play. The expert player will be the “competition” AI.
- Network play over the internet.
- Automated install and uninstall of your game.
- In-game help assistance.
- Game must be connected with a theme. For example, games in past years have had such themes as: Hawaiian tiki men, Military, Biblical, and Space.
